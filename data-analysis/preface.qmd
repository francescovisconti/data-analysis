# Why Data analysis?

## What is the object of this book?

-   Data are empirical material organised into a form that can be analysed.

-   Data analysis is a process of gathering, inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modelling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions and supporting decision-making.\

## What is the objective of this course?

-   To help you become a better consumer of information and academic research:

    -   learn how to read and interpret a table or a chart;

-   To start you on the road to becoming a producer of information and research:

    -   to pose a question and look for relevant data;

    -   to collect, download, manage, explore, and analyse data;

    -   to communicate findings using graphs and tables

## Why learning Excel?

-   Microsoft Excel is the most popular computer spreadsheet programme that can be used to store and analyse large quantities of data.

-   Excel has many functions to sort and analyse the data that range from basic mathematical functions to complex statistical analyses.

-   It is one of the most widely used programmes of its kind across the globe and has become the industry standard.

## What is Excel?

-   A spreadsheet is an interactive computer application for the organisation, analysis, and storage of data in tabular form.\
    (Source: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet> )

-   A spreadsheet consists of a table of cells arranged into rows and columns and referred to by the X (Columns) and Y (Rows) locations.

-   Columns locations are normally represented by letters, "A", "B", "C", etc., while rows are normally represented by numbers, 1, 2, 3, etc.

-   A single cell can be referred to by addressing its row and column, "C10" for instance (like playing battleship).

-   What makes a spreadsheet software program unique is its ability to calculate values using mathematical formulas and the data in cells.

### Spreadsheets basic components

-   **Cell\
    ** A box for holding data. A single cell is usually referenced by its column and row.

-   **Worksheet/Sheet\
    ** A grid of cells with either raw data, called values, or formulas in the cells.

-   **Values\
    ** Raw data (general numbers, text, dates). Alternatively, a value can be based on a formula, which might perform a calculation.

-   **Formulas** say how to mechanically compute new values from existing values.

-   **Functions\
    ** Built-in functions, such as arithmetic operations (for example, summations, averages), trigonometric functions, statistical functions, etc..

-   **Charts\
    ** Graphical display of data.

### History of spreadsheets

-   VisiCalc by Dan Bricklin released in1979

    -   It was the first spreadsheet computer program for personal computers, originally released for the Apple II.

    -   It is considered the application that turned the microcomputer from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a serious business tool. VisiCalc is considered the Apple II's killer app.

    -   It sold over 700,000 copies in six years, and as many as 1 million copies over its history.

-   Lotus 1-2-3 by Lotus Software (1983)

    -   Added the possibility of creating graphs

-   Microsoft Excel released in 1985 for Macintosh Apple II and in 1987 on Windows

    -   By the early 1990s, Excel had started to outsell Lotus 1-2-3 and helped Microsoft achieve its position as a leading PC software developer.
