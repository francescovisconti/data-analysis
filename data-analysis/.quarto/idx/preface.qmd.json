A single cell is usually referenced by its column and row.\n\n-   **Worksheet/Sheet\\\n    ** A grid of cells with either raw data, called values, or formulas in the cells.\n\n-   **Values\\\n    ** Raw data (general numbers, text, dates). Alternatively, a value can be based on a formula, which might perform a calculation.\n\n-   **Formulas** say how to mechanically compute new values from existing values.\n\n-   **Functions\\\n    ** Built-in functions, such as arithmetic operations (for example, summations, averages), trigonometric functions, statistical functions, etc..\n\n-   **Charts\\\n    ** Graphical display of data.\n\n### History of spreadsheets\n\n-   VisiCalc by Dan Bricklin released in1979\n\n    -   It was the first spreadsheet computer program for personal computers, originally released for the Apple II.\n\n    -   It is considered the application that turned the microcomputer from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a serious business tool. VisiCalc is considered the Apple II's killer app.\n\n    -   It sold over 700,000 copies in six years, and as many as 1 million copies over its history.\n\n-   Lotus 1-2-3 by Lotus Software (1983)\n\n    -   Added the possibility of creating graphs\n\n-   Microsoft Excel released in 1985 for Macintosh Apple II and in 1987 on Windows\n\n    -   By the early 1990s, Excel had started to outsell Lotus 1-2-3 and helped Microsoft achieve its position as a leading PC software developer.\n\n    ### How to get it?\n\n-   Office 365 Education\n\n-   Using your Unimi email (name.surname\\@studenti.unimi.it) at this link: <https://www.microsoft.com/it-it/education/products/office>\n\n-   MS Excel for Linux users\n\n    -   Use Wine https://www.winehq.org/ : allows you to run Windows apps on Linux.\n\n    -   Use Microsoft Excel via browser:\n\n        -   Go to <https://www.office.com>\n\n        -   Sign in with your Unimi user account\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"preface.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"preface.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
